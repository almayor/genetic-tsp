# Genetic Travelling Salesman

### Overview

* A simple genetic algorithm for the [Travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). 
* < 100 lines of code
* Achieves reasonable performance for 25 and 50 cities, although gets stuck in local minima (travel loops) with increasing complexity

### 25 cities

* Convergence is fast

### 50 cities
